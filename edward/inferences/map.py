  This class implements gradient-based optimization to solve the
  optimization problem,

  $\min_{z} - p(z \mid x).$

  This is equivalent to using a `PointMass` variational distribution
  and minimizing the unnormalized objective,

  $- \mathbb{E}_{q(z; \lambda)} [ \log p(x, z) ].$

  #### Notes

  This class is currently restricted to optimization over
  differentiable latent variables. For example, it does not solve
  discrete optimization.

  This class also minimizes the loss with respect to any model
  parameters $p(z \mid x; \\theta)$.

  In conditional inference, we infer $z$ in $p(z, \\beta
  \mid x)$ while fixing inference over $\\beta$ using another
  distribution $q(\\beta)$. `MAP` optimizes
  $\mathbb{E}_{q(\\beta)} [ \log p(x, z, \\beta) ]$, leveraging
  a single Monte Carlo sample, $\log p(x, z, \\beta^*)$, where
  $\\beta^* \sim q(\\beta)$. This is a lower bound to the
  marginal density $\log p(x, z)$, and it is exact if
  $q(\\beta) = p(\\beta \mid x)$ (up to stochasticity).

  #### Examples

  Most explicitly, `MAP` is specified via a dictionary:

  ```python
  qpi = PointMass(params=ed.to_simplex(tf.Variable(tf.zeros(K-1))))
  qmu = PointMass(params=tf.Variable(tf.zeros(K*D)))
  qsigma = PointMass(params=tf.nn.softplus(tf.Variable(tf.zeros(K*D))))
  ed.MAP({pi: qpi, mu: qmu, sigma: qsigma}, data)
  ```

  We also automate the specification of `PointMass` distributions,
  so one can pass in a list of latent variables instead:

  ```python
  ed.MAP([beta], data)
  ed.MAP([pi, mu, sigma], data)
  ```

  Note that for `MAP` to optimize over latent variables with
  constrained continuous support, the point mass must be constrained
  to have the same support while its free parameters are
  unconstrained; see, e.g., `qsigma` above. This is different than
  performing MAP on the unconstrained space: in general, the MAP of
  the transform is not the transform of the MAP.

  The objective function also adds to itself a summation over all
  tensors in the `REGULARIZATION_LOSSES` collection.
