  """Laplace approximation [@laplace1986memoir].

  It approximates the posterior distribution using a multivariate
  normal distribution centered at the mode of the posterior.

  We implement this by running `MAP` to find the posterior mode.
  This forms the mean of the normal approximation. We then compute the
  inverse Hessian at the mode of the posterior. This forms the
  covariance of the normal approximation.

  #### Notes

  If `MultivariateNormalDiag` or `Normal` random variables are
  specified as approximations, then the Laplace approximation will
  only produce the diagonal. This does not capture correlation among
  the variables but it does not require a potentially expensive
  matrix inversion.

  Random variables with both scalar batch and event shape are not
  supported as `tf.hessians` is currently not applicable to scalars.

  Note that `Laplace` finds the location parameter of the normal
  approximation using `MAP`, which is performed on the latent
  variable's original (constrained) support. The scale parameter
  is calculated by evaluating the Hessian of $-\log p(x, z)$ in the
  constrained space and under the mode. This implies the Laplace
  approximation always has real support even if the target
  distribution has constrained support.

  #### Examples

  ```python
  X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [N, D])
  w = Normal(loc=tf.zeros(D), scale=tf.ones(D))
  y = Normal(loc=ed.dot(X, w), scale=tf.ones(N))

  qw = MultivariateNormalTriL(
      loc=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([D])),
      scale_tril=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([D, D])))

  inference = ed.Laplace({w: qw}, data={X: X_train, y: y_train})
  ```
