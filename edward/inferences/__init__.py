"""
There are two approaches to inference.

1. Idiomatic TensorFlow
  1. Build train_op (*).
  2. Build summary file writer.
  3. Build and run TensorFlow variable initializer ops.
  4. Build progressbar (*).
  5. Within a training loop:
    + sess.run with infeeding and summary writers.
    + Update progressbar (*).
    + Check convergence (*).
  6. Build and run post-training ops (*).
2. Idiomatic TensorFlow Estimator
  + Call train() (*). It is a higher-order function taking in the
  model program, data, an optional inference function to build the
  train_op, and various other things. As an inference engine, it
  automates the process above.

Inference provides functions for both approaches. In the first
approach, it provides (*), namely: (1) inference algorithms to help
produce the train_op (and low-level functions to build your own
algorithms); (2) a progressbar to build and update; (3) convergence
diagnostics; and (4) post-training ops for certain algorithms. In the
second approach, it provides the fully automated train().

Inference uses (unbinded) pure functions with TensorFlow idiomatic
exceptions (e.g., mutable state via TensorFlow variables; side effect
of adding to global collections and TF graph). It forgoes OO.

This file is a collection of functions shared across inference
algorithms, used for the following:

+ "call f up to args" (in `inferences/inference`)
+ a "make intercept" factory (in `inferences/inference`)
+ automated transforms (in `inferences/inference` and `util/random_variables`)
+ programmatic docstrings (in `inferences/docstrings`)
+ `train` (in `inferences/inference`)

Specific inference files provide functions to help produce the train
(and post-training) ops.
